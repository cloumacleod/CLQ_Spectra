Data files listing BH masses and bolometric luminosities for
each subsample shown in Figure 6, so one can calculate the
quantities shown on the x-axis in each panel. Make 4 files: 1 for
the EVQ sample, 1 for the control sample, and 2 for the CLQs. The
2nd file for the CLQs has a column for dim-state values and observed
luminosity change of the 3240A continuum.
